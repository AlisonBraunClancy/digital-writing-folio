#### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?
   Fiction, mainly fantasy and historical fantasy.
#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
   Microsoft Word, the pomodoro technique, trying to write down at least 100 words a day, even if they are bad words.
