### Questions

#### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?
   Fiction, mainly fantasy and historical fantasy.
#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
   Microsoft Word, the pomodoro technique, trying to write down at least 100 words a day, even if they are bad words.
#### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
   They help me get around to actually writing, rather then just imagining scenarios in my head or procrastinating, or freaking out over whether each word is perfect and editing as I go.
